# course-registration-system-SPL-ASS3
A basic server-client system for courses registration.<br />
In this work we have implemented a server based on the reactor design pattern and the encoder-decoder model. Our server is built in java and the client side is built in cpp.<br />
<br />
This project was given as an assignment in the course "System Programming" (2021 Fall). Course site: https://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~spl211/Main.
